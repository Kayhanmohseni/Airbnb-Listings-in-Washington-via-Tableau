### Data Cleaning

Most of the data was reliable. 
I made minimal changes, only using Microsoft Excel to remove duplicates.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring layoff data to answer key questions below:

- What is the average price of the listings based on zip code?
- What time of the year is best to list a property on Airbnb?
- What is the average price of the listings based on the number of bedrooms?
- What is the number of listings per number of bedrooms?


### Data Analysis

SQL queries used:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2;
```

1. sds
