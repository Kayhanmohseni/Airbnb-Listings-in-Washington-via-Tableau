### Data Cleaning

Most of the data was reliable. 
I made minimal changes, only using Microsoft Excel to remove duplicates.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring layoff data to answer key questions below:

- What is the average price of the listings based on zip code?
- What time of the year is best to list a property on Airbnb in Washington?
